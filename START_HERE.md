## 📋 TODAY'S TASKS (Choose Your Path)

### **Path 1: Quick API Conversion** ⭐ (Recommended First)

#### **Task 1: Create Express API Wrapper** (2-3 hours)

I can help you create:

- `src/api/server.js` - Express server
- API endpoints to trigger your email sender
- Authentication middleware
- Deploy configuration

**Result:** Your CLI becomes an API service

#### **Task 2: Test API Locally** (30 minutes)

```bash
# Test with curl or Postman
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"csvPath": "./data/emails.csv"}'
```

#### **Task 3: Deploy to Railway** (1 hour)

- Push to GitHub
- Connect Railway
- Deploy in minutes
- Get live API URL

**By End of Today: Working API that anyone can call** ✅

---

### **Path 2: Start Full SaaS** (Longer but Complete)

#### **Task 1: Create Accounts** (15 minutes)

- [ ] Supabase: https://supabase.com
- [ ] Vercel: https://vercel.com
- [ ] Railway: https://railway.app
- [ ] Stripe: https://stripe.com

#### **Task 2: Create Next.js App** (30 minutes)

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest sendy-saas
cd sendy-saas
npm run dev
```

#### **Task 3: Setup Supabase** (1 hour)

- Create new project
- Copy credentials
- Install Supabase client
- Test connection

**By End of Today: Empty Next.js app connected to Supabase** ✅

## 🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION

### **Do Both in Parallel:**

**This Week (Backend):**

1. Convert CLI to API (I'll help)
2. Deploy to Railway
3. Test it works

**Next Week (Frontend):** 4. Start Next.js app 5. Build login/signup 6. Create dashboard

**Week 3 (Connect):** 7. Connect frontend to backend API 8. First end-to-end test 9. You have a working MVP!
